## Breaking the Pact
[[Ras Nsi]] is stabbed in the heart by [[Morgan]], and the giant [[Yuan-ti]] monster dissipates into the pool of blood.

On [[Ozymandius|Ozzy]] and [[Ras Nsi]]'s body we find the last puzzle cubes and some sending stones.

[[Artus Cimber]] uses the [[Daijobi Senga]] to open a portal to [[The Lost City of Mezero|Mezero]]. Inside there's a throne of bones and a Rakshasa atop it. He proposes Team Cimber heads on in to liberate Mezero while we deal with the Tomb of Annihilation.

Inside the portal, we see flashes of different time periods. Wars with WW1/WW2 technology, and a maze city looming in the distance.

We start to say our goodbyes to [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]], [[Xandala Cimber|Xandala]], and everyone else going into the portal. [[Orvex Ocrammas]] pops out of the corner and we try to figure out what he should do. He thinks he has the best odds in the tomb. [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] gives most people a firm handshake, but [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] gets a hug.

As the portal disappears, we see silver flames appear right in front of where the portal was. Two figures appear and we see two figures. One looks like [[Morgan]] and the other like [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]], but with a sword and looking healthier. Multiverse [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] gives us some time magic boons:
- Artus: The party gets one casting of Freezing Sphere per long rest
- Alisanda: The party gets one casting of Heal per long rest
- Valindra: The party gets one cast of Temporal Shunt per long rest
- Xandala: The party gets one cast of Polymorph per long rest. When this spell is cast, roll twice on the Net Libram wild magic surge table and choose an effect to happen

We arrive at the entrance to the tomb, and find an obelisk with mysterious writing.

> The enemies oppose
> One stands between them
> In darkness, it hides
> Don the mask, or be seen
> Speak no truth to the doomed child
> The keys turn on the inside only

We take a long rest in a hidden cave with eight statues to the trickster gods. The flail snail god is missing. Behind a secret door we find the last statue with a magical gold medallion. It might be cursed. It can open like a locket.

The enemy trickster gods in the story are on opposite sides of each other.

We find a 3x3 grid of cube slots, [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] puts [[Unkh]] in the middle and the others opposing their enemy. Inside we find an illusion of [[Acererak]]. He congratulates us, tells us that there's nine trickster gods in the shrine and each will give us a boon that helps us in the tomb.

There's extra treasures, and the tomb gets harder and harder the deeper we get. There's also 5 Skeleton Keys (actual skeletons), which we'll need to unlock the skeleton gate on the 6th floor.

Teleportation spells that take out of the tomb instead send us to The Oubiette. Then you have a 50/50 chance of dying or teleporting to the entrance of the tomb.

After the speech, the illusion disappears and we're left with a green demon mask. We kill the shadow demon hiding within.

We go left, smash a window, kill some wights, and find the tomb of [[Obo'laka]]. Inside the sarcophagus we find a magic ring. A spirit jumps out and tries to possess [[Morgan]]!
