## First Floor
[[Brysh]] gets slightly possessed by the ghost of a trickster god. [[Obo'laka]]. Brysh gets a passive boon: she can attune to one additional magic item. However when [[Obo'laka]] leaves Brysh, all her magic items have their attunement broken. There's also a secret RP requirement.

Later we fight a Flame Skull and [[Sylvos]] attunes. He gets a "secret" RP requirement, and can turn invisible as an action. Sylvos then asks which trickster gods they cannot trust.
- [[Wongo]] is real bad
- [[Nangnang]]
- [[Papazotl]]

[[Obo'laka]] also warns of [[I'jin]].

[[Locke Hancock|Locke]] has a pretty bad seniors moment. The party is starting to get concernedâ€¦

Later [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] lures Mr Bones to him using a gold coin (which is perfect for his eye socket). However Mr Bones then tries to return to his room, but his skull gets pulled into a magnet shield. It seems like Mr Bones has died, but we get the skeleton key.
## Second Floor
There's masked dwarves doing diabolical work on strange machines. They are zombies owned by Withers, who keeps the traps in working order. He gives [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] a bell to ring in case any of the traps malfunction.

In a magic fountain, we see the first person perspective of someone walking down a hallway with animal statues on one side. The hallway is full of ankle deep water.

[[Brysh]] stole a note from Wither's study:
![[112-ph22.webp]]

```
The dead abhore sunlight
Only a jewel can tame the frog
Bow as the dead god intonned
Into darkness descend
```

[[Brysh]] and [[Morgan]] look into the fountain again. Now the vision is walking through a hallway with purple fungus.

We end the session entering a room with a giant bird, bronze statues, Chultan warriors, and more.
