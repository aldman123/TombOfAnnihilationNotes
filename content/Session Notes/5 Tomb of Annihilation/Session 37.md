Inside [[Kubazan]]'s sarcophagus, [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] accepts [[Kubazan]]'s presence and gets his bracers of archery. [[Kubazan]] also makes his strength score 23.

>Walk through water with weapon in hand.
>Slake your shadow at the font.
>The vulture is the first step.
>Right the gods.
>The walls of history tell all.

In a sauna, [[Locke Hancock|Locke]]'s shadow drinks all the water in the font. This reveals a crystal beholder orange eyeball.

Next we reach a hieroglyph puzzle. After some teamwork we open [[I'jin]]'s sarcophagus. [[Kubazan]] and [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] fight [[I'jin]] off and get a Wand of Wonder.

We then get another couple eyeballs (green and purple) in angel statues behind hidden passages.

We've exhausted the obvious passages on the 3rd floor, but still no skeleton key. Luckily [[Morgan]] found some narrow passageways earlier we can check out.

We get two more eyeballs in a jumping room. Pearl and scarlet colored.

In a spinning room, we get two more eyes: a vibrant purple and a dark blue.

Next we get to a room with statues representing Azuth God of Wizardry and Torm God of Self Sacrifice. [[Brysh]] gets accidentally teleported into an area with a clay golem. Luckily she's able to put it asleep. She gets a pale green eye, a pink eye, and a red eye.

Afterwards we take a long rest in a makeshift safe room. [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] gets his sight back, [[Brysh]] regains her max HP, and everyone is happy.
