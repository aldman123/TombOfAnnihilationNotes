We figure out the skeleton puzzle, kill a bunch of bone men, and get some gold. We also find a hidden room attached to it with weird purple goo.

We return to the strange coffin room and trigger the trap, but beforehand [[Brysh]] uses an immovable rod to prevent the door from closing. Wine Weirds attack us and try to drown us in an inch of wine!

On the second level, we find some tomb guards attached by a chain. They seem to be what we saw through the water last session. After killing them we find the [[Omu]] court jester [[Yaka]], who's now a skull with human eyes.

Next we reach the shrine of [[Kubazan]]. [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] is quite excited, but he's unable to appease [[Kubazan]]. [[Sylvos]] gets turned into a frog and wraiths attack. [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] "accidentally" casts Forget on himself causing him to **frog**-et about the frog.

We take a short rest inside [[Brysh]]'s urn for the first time. Inside there's an ooze man named [[Glurk]] who's her "employee".
