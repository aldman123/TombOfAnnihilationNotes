We figure out the skeleton puzzle, kill a bunch of bone men, and get some gold. We also find a hidden room attached to it with weird purple goo.

We return to the strange coffin room and trigger the trap, but beforehand [[Brysh]] uses an immovable rod to prevent the door from closing. Wine Weirds attack us and try to drown us in an inch of wine!
