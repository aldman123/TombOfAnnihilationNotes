We enter the room, and find the catacombs below Paris. Bones are everywhere, and there's an opal crown on a pillow. [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] puts the crown on right as some undead monsters begin attacking [[Brysh]] around the corner.

Afterwards, a weird humming sound comes from the mouth. [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] puts both his hands into the mouth, and it turns out to be a sphere of annihilation. He loses both his hands.

Since the crown is transmutation, we spend some time to attune to it. Once per day, we can use it to cast Regenerate. Locke is all healed up, and we jump down the hole and reach the next level.
# 5th Floor
We fight some shambling mounds.

There's pentagonal rooms with a weird control panel. [[Morgan]] pulls the lever, and slime pours out of the pipes. [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] takes control. Moving the blue dial switching the # of the activated position, and pushing the blue button rotates the room to match that state. We haven't pushed the red buttons yet.

While he waits, a slimy presence offers to remove the tadpole from [[Locke Hancock|Locke]]'s mind. The faceless man "[[Golorr]]" in a suit tells him to meet on the NE side of the lake after going through a secret door.

In a southern hallway, there's words scrawled in blood: "Awaken Napaka" (the queen of Omu). There's a fantasy steam roller that seems to be meant to run us over.

We take the boats and visit the NE cavern. There's a waterfall and a bunch of bioluminescent crabs. We notice and Aboleth who rises up to greet us. It's [[Golorr]], and it makes a Warlock pact with [[Locke Hancock|Locke]].

After another short bit of exploring and fighting, we take a long rest. We decide to soft-lock the gear puzzle to bring [[Rodvan]] with us to the final boss fight with [[Acererak]].

We pass by a chaotic bridge between the chaos planes and the shadowfell.
# Cradle of the Dead God
We see a coven of three hags. They seem to be the former friends of [[Nanny Pu'pu]]!

The hags inform us that inside the next room is the stillborn child of gods. [[Acererak]] found it in the negative energy plane, and they're pumping it full of souls to revive it. Atropal is tangled in biological and mechanic tubes. The faces of screaming souls are pumping into it by the [[Soul Mongerer]].

*"The gang kills a fetus"*

[[Locke Hancock|Locke]] finally gets up after being downed for two rounds, pulls out a wand of magic missiles, and fires. [[Acererak]] casts shield, and [[Brysh]] uses her ring of counterspells to stop it.
# Epilogue
On [[Acererak]]'s body, we find
- A spell book containing every Wizard spell
- Talisman of the Sphere
- Staff of the Forgotten One

Using the portal in [[Acererak]]'s lair, it shows us [[The Lost City of Mezero]], which has been returned to the material plane. They drive car-like wagons down the street, and [[Brysh]] checks out the market. [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] sends a message to [[Locke Hancock|Locke]], and the party is able to meet up in the center of the city at the Temple of [[Ubtao]].

All the Cimbers and a strange older man meet us there. [[Xandala Cimber|Xandala]] runs in for hugs. [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] seems a little brighter, yet still undead. [[Artus Cimber|Artus]] introduces us to [[Alisandra Cimber]]. They all thank us greatly.

Via a divine intervention, [[Ubtao]] helped resolve the mental problems that [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] underwent when turning into a lich. She no longer needs mind blanks daily.

We all take a little vacation in [[The Lost City of Mezero|Mezero]]. [[Morgan]] learns as much as she can about [[The Red Wizards of Thay]] from [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]]. [[Morgan]] focuses on killing and disrupting [[The Red Wizards of Thay]] whenever possible.

[[Artus Cimber|Artus]] and [[Sylvos]] rejoin [[The Harpers]] and go to fight the good fight.

[[Brysh]] builds up a fleet of ships and gains a near monopoly on the adamantine business.

[[Locke Hancock|Locke]] is always claiming he'll be heading out to the Astral Sea and reunite with Betsy, but in reality he stays far longer than expected. [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] becomes a professor of archeology again in a college in [[The Lost City of Mezero|Mezero]]. [[Rodvan]] joins him, and they get lunch together occasionally. After a decade or two, he finally departs using the portal at the end of the tomb.
